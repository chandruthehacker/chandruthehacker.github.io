    description: `Detects malicious emails using Google Generative AI
## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
‚úÖ Scans email headers, subject, and body for phishing indicators.  
‚úÖ Uses NLP to detect urgency/scare tactics (e.g., "Your account is locked!").  
‚úÖ Returns a risk like (Legitimate/Phishing).  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
Extracts email text (Gmail API/IMAP).  
Sends content to Google Generative AI for analysis.  
Flags suspicious patterns (fake links, impersonation).  

## üß™ Testing & Results  
Tested on **100+ phishing samples** (Accuracy: 90%).  
Reduced false positives by **20%** with keyword filtering.

    description: `A CLI tool to parse, analyze, and visualize security logs with threat detection.
## üõ†Ô∏è Features
‚úÖ Automatically detects log types (Apache/Nginx/Syslog/auth.log)
‚úÖ Parses logs using regex to extract IPs, timestamps, and events
‚úÖ Detects brute-force SSH attacks (>5 failed logins in 5 mins)
‚úÖ Flags suspicious sudo activity and odd-hour logins
‚úÖ Identifies geo-based anomalies (unexpected country logins)
‚úÖ Outputs results as CSV, Excel, or Matplotlib charts

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Ingests raw log files via CLI path or drag-and-drop
Classifies log type and extracts key data using Pandas
Applies threat detection rules (customizable thresholds)
Generates reports in multiple formats:
CSV/Excel for SIEM integration
Interactive charts for attack visualization

## üß™ Testing & Results
Tested on **100+ real-world logs** (AWS/on-prem servers)
Detected **90%** of simulated attacks vs manual review's 70%
Reduced analysis time by **60%** compared to manual processes

    description: `Deployed a honeypot in a VM to log attacker behavior by simulating vulnerable services.
## üõ†Ô∏è Features
‚úÖ Simulates realistic login pages (Fake admin portals/OAuth)
‚úÖ Logs attacker IPs, user agents, and timestamps
‚úÖ Records brute-force patterns and password attempts
‚úÖ Tracks geographical locations of malicious visitors
‚úÖ Generates threat reports with access heatmaps

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Hosts fake login interface (HTML/CSS indistinguishable from real systems)
Captures all submitted credentials (never stored/used)
Logs detailed metadata:
Browser fingerprints
Attack timing patterns
GeoIP data (via free API)

## üîç Outputs analysis:
Top attacker IPs
Common brute-force dictionaries
Geographic threat map

## üß™ Testing & Results
Collected **200+ malicious** attempts during 2-week deployment
Identified **3 distinct** attack patterns (credential stuffing, dictionary attacks)
Mapped threats from **12 countries** (85% from unexpected regions)

A responsive and interactive web tool that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords in real time and provides actionable feedback for stronger credentials.

## üîê Key Features
üß† Analyzes passwords for length, character variety, and patterns  
‚ö†Ô∏è Detects common weaknesses (e.g., all lowercase, repetitive chars, dictionary words)  
‚úÖ Provides live feedback with strength levels (Weak, Moderate, Strong)  
üé® Modern UI with animated indicators and color-coded messages  
üì± Fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Captures user input and evaluates against defined security rules  
- Uses JavaScript logic to calculate entropy and strength  
- Displays dynamic visual feedback using progress bars and tips  
- Built with clean HTML/CSS and efficient JS for speed and responsiveness

## üß™ Testing & Results
üîç Tested with **100+ real-world password samples**  
üõ°Ô∏è Identified **100% weak passwords** accurately  
üöÄ Enhanced user awareness about password hygiene during demos
