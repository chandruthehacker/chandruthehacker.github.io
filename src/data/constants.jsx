    description: `Detects malicious emails using Google Generative AI
## 🛠️ Features  
✅ Scans email headers, subject, and body for phishing indicators.  
✅ Uses NLP to detect urgency/scare tactics (e.g., "Your account is locked!").  
✅ Returns a risk like (Legitimate/Phishing).  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
Extracts email text (Gmail API/IMAP).  
Sends content to Google Generative AI for analysis.  
Flags suspicious patterns (fake links, impersonation).  

## 🧪 Testing & Results  
Tested on **100+ phishing samples** (Accuracy: 90%).  
Reduced false positives by **20%** with keyword filtering.

    title: "Log Analysis Tool",
    date: "2025",
    description: `A CLI tool to parse, analyze, and visualize security logs with threat detection.
## 🛠️ Features
✅ Automatically detects log types (Apache/Nginx/Syslog/auth.log)
✅ Parses logs using regex to extract IPs, timestamps, and events
✅ Detects brute-force SSH attacks (>5 failed logins in 5 mins)
✅ Flags suspicious sudo activity and odd-hour logins
✅ Identifies geo-based anomalies (unexpected country logins)
✅ Outputs results as CSV, Excel, or Matplotlib charts

## ⚙️ How It Works
Ingests raw log files via CLI path or drag-and-drop
Classifies log type and extracts key data using Pandas
Applies threat detection rules (customizable thresholds)
Generates reports in multiple formats:
CSV/Excel for SIEM integration
Interactive charts for attack visualization

## 🧪 Testing & Results
Tested on **100+ real-world logs** (AWS/on-prem servers)
Detected **90%** of simulated attacks vs manual review's 70%
Reduced analysis time by **60%** compared to manual processes

    date: "2025",
    description: `Deployed a honeypot in a VM to log attacker behavior by simulating vulnerable services.
## 🛠️ Features
✅ Simulates realistic login pages (Fake admin portals/OAuth)
✅ Logs attacker IPs, user agents, and timestamps
✅ Records brute-force patterns and password attempts
✅ Tracks geographical locations of malicious visitors
✅ Generates threat reports with access heatmaps

## ⚙️ How It Works
Hosts fake login interface (HTML/CSS indistinguishable from real systems)
Captures all submitted credentials (never stored/used)
Logs detailed metadata:
Browser fingerprints
Attack timing patterns
GeoIP data (via free API)

## 🔍 Outputs analysis:
Top attacker IPs
Common brute-force dictionaries
Geographic threat map

## 🧪 Testing & Results
Collected **200+ malicious** attempts during 2-week deployment
Identified **3 distinct** attack patterns (credential stuffing, dictionary attacks)
Mapped threats from **12 countries** (85% from unexpected regions)

    title: "Password Strength Checker",
    date: "2025",
    description: `
A responsive and interactive web tool that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords in real time and provides actionable feedback for stronger credentials.

## 🔐 Key Features
🧠 Analyzes passwords for length, character variety, and patterns  
⚠️ Detects common weaknesses (e.g., all lowercase, repetitive chars, dictionary words)  
✅ Provides live feedback with strength levels (Weak, Moderate, Strong)  
🎨 Modern UI with animated indicators and color-coded messages  
📱 Fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Captures user input and evaluates against defined security rules  
- Uses JavaScript logic to calculate entropy and strength  
- Displays dynamic visual feedback using progress bars and tips  
- Built with clean HTML/CSS and efficient JS for speed and responsiveness

## 🧪 Testing & Results
🔍 Tested with **100+ real-world password samples**  
🛡️ Identified **100% weak passwords** accurately  
🚀 Enhanced user awareness about password hygiene during demos
